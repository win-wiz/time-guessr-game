# Time Guessr Game Project Information

## Project Overview
Time Guessr is a historical geography guessing game developed with Next.js 15. Players need to guess the year and location of events based on historical photos, receiving score feedback through an intelligent scoring system.

## Core Gameplay
- View historical event images and descriptions
- Guess the specific year when the event occurred
- Mark the event location on Google Maps
- Receive scores based on time and location accuracy
- Complete 5 rounds of gameplay and view overall results and leaderboards

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (React)
- **Development Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Map Service**: Google Maps API
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Data Source**: Third-party API integration

## Main Features

### Game System
- Multi-round game flow (default 5 rounds)
- Real-time timing system
- Intelligent hints and clue system
- Game progress saving and recovery
- Multiple game modes (timed mode, practice mode, etc.)

### Scoring Mechanism
- **Time Dimension Scoring**: Based on year guess accuracy, maximum 1000 points
- **Geographic Location Scoring**: Based on distance accuracy, calculated using Haversine formula
- **Reward System**: Speed bonus, streak bonus, perfect guess bonus
- **Level System**: 7-tier scoring system from "Perfect" to "Poor"

### User Experience
- Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop
- Dark/light theme switching
- Detailed result display pages
- Map visualization comparison (actual location vs guessed location)
- Achievement system and leaderboards

### Performance Optimization
- React.memo component optimization
- useCallback and useMemo caching strategies
- Component lazy loading
- API response caching
- Local storage of game state

## Environment Configuration
The following environment variables need to be configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` - API access key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Google Maps API key

## Development Features
- Complete TypeScript type definitions
- Detailed error handling and fallback strategies
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit tests and integration tests)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Anti-cheating mechanisms
- Internationalization support preparation

## Game Data
The game uses historical event data, including:
- Historical event images
- Event descriptions and background information
- Accurate time and geographic location information
- Difficulty level classification
- Related historical background knowledge

This project demonstrates modern web game development best practices, combining educational and entertainment value to provide users with an interesting way to learn historical knowledge.
